Home Price Analysis System
This project is a simple yet effective tool for analyzing and predicting home prices using machine learning. It is designed for real estate data analysis and price estimation based on key property features.

Features
.Data Management:

Loads and saves property data (area, number of rooms, price) from a CSV file.
Allows users to add new property records interactively.

.Data Visualization:

Plots the relationship between area and price.
Plots the relationship between the number of rooms and price.
.Price Prediction:

Uses a Linear Regression model to predict the price of new properties based on area and number of rooms.
.Model Insights:

Displays the importance (coefficient) of each feature in the price prediction model.
.Data Cleaning:

Automatically removes incomplete or invalid records before training the model to ensure robust predictions.
How It Works
Start the program.
Add new property data or use the existing dataset.
Visualize the data to understand trends.
Predict prices for new properties by entering their area and number of rooms.
View model coefficients to see how each feature affects the predicted price.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage
Run the script and follow the on-screen menu to manage data, visualize trends, and predict home prices.
